Simple java library to access weather data from weather service yr.no

Usage:

See YrRequestProcessorTest for simple usage example.

Remove the URL string argument to send the query to yr.no servers. The URL can be used to query a local copy of a real forecast.xml instead of spamming yr.no servers.

YrRequestProcessor is a singleton instance that is caching the forecast xml files according to the yr.no usage terms so if you keep your java program running the xml-file will be cached and a new copy read when the nextupdate period has been exceeded.

List of Countries, Region and Cities can be found at yr.no

YrResult contains basic data for all forecasts (like creditURL, sunrise, sunset...) and an ArrayList of all the forecasts for each period in YrForecast classes.
YrForecast contains all forecast data. 

Remember to read the yr.no usage terms at http://www.yr.no/verdata/1.6810075



Lib dependencies:

Jdom and JodaTime.



This library isn't finnished yet but works.
